                Fernando Alonso Díaz born 29 July 1981, is a Spanish racing driver currently racing for Alpine in Formula One. 
                He won the series' World Drivers' Championship in 2005 and 2006 with Renault, having also driven for McLaren, Ferrari and Minardi. 
                With Toyota, Alonso won the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice, in 2018 and 2019, and the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2018–19. 
                In 2019, he won the 24 Hours of Daytona with Wayne Taylor Racing.

                Born in Oviedo, Asturias to a working-class family, he began go-karting at the age of three and achieved success in local, national and world championships. 
                Alonso progressed to car racing at age 17, winning the Euro Open by Nissan in 1999 and was fourth in the International Formula 3000 Championship of 2000. 
                He debuted in Formula One with Minardi in 2001 before joining Renault as a test driver for 2002. 
                Promoted to a race seat in 2003, Alonso won two drivers' championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming (at the time) the youngest pole-sitter, youngest race winner, youngest world champion, and youngest two-time champion in the sport's history. 
                After finishing third with McLaren in 2007, he returned to Renault for 2008 and 2009 and won two races in the former year for fifth overall. 
                Alonso drove for Ferrari from 2010 to 2014, finishing runner-up to Sebastian Vettel in three tightly-contested title duels in 2010, 2012, and 2013. 
                A second stint with McLaren from 2015 to 2018 resulted in no further success.

            <p>
                Overall, Alonso won 32 Formula One races, 22 pole positions, and 1,899 points from 311 starts. 
                He is the only Spanish Formula One driver to have won both a Grand Prix and the World Championship.
                He won the 2001 Race of Champions Nations Cup with the rally driver Jesús Puras and the motorcyclist Rubén Xaus for Team Spain and thrice entered the Indianapolis 500 in 2017, 2019 and 2020. 
                Alonso has been awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Sports, the Premios Nacionales del Deporte Sportsman of the Year Award and the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit and has twice been inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame. 
                He runs an eSports and junior racing team and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.
